# Geneerous-
futuristic, wishlisty Geneswapping site

####
(note: this is not a startup idea, already working on an actual attempt at such with different concept)

Design Concept:
the below link is a video from Bryan Johnson (vegan 100 pills a day, sold venmo to paypal).
He mentions a new experimental approach of gene-therapy: The labfolk figured a way to determine nullifying agents that undo gene therapy.

just stretching idea reflex and design concept reflex. 
while typing readme figured the logo to be a GuineaPig and that it could be a pastiche of the GoLang Gopher.


// readme almost done but now also think I know where this idea came from:
recently used a {testTube.png} as a visual representation for "testwaters" feature on my Next-Water-App repo. 
This app would have cool test-tubes and visualizations for the genes. 
// dating (and possibly alienating) self but experience should be somewhat like pokemon daycare. The berries, non-static-stat-boosting, 

// more ideas:
like pokemon daycare There's no +5 in one area without other areas getting affected so the entire app would be people coming together:
Given their MBTI, mind/body, interests, backgrounds.. what... what I'll call "stat-boosting-blend" delivers most impact and affect
